#### MapReduce Parallelism
- The key reason to perform mapping and reducing is to speed up the executon of a specific process by spilting a process  into number of tasks, this encorages parallelism in job flow.

#### Input split and reorder reader
- Used to spliting data as key and value
- Record reader (RR) are used to split sectences
1. First **Input** of a sentence is put through **Input Split**
2. The o/t of **InputSplit** is words from the sentences.
3. After going through **Record Reader** store the words as key and value pairs with numbers.
4. **Maps** maps the value and key pairs
5. **Intermediate O/P in disk** Keeps the output under a temporary storage.
